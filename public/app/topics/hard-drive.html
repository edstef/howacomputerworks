				<p>A hard drive (or hard disk drive) is used to store information on a rotating disk which is also called a platter [3]. The disk is made from a shiny material (such as aluminum or even glass) and has a magnetic layer coated around it. This allows the information to stay on the disk even when the computer is turned off.</p>

			<p>A hard drive (or hard disk drive) is used to store information on a rotating disk which is also called a platter [3]. The disk is made from a shiny material (such as aluminum or even glass) and has a magnetic layer coated around it. This allows the information to stay on the disk even when the computer is turned off. The disk is connected to a spindle in the middle which spins really fast because of the motor under the disk.</p>

			<p>There is also a disk arm which moves very quickly across the disk. This is the part that can ‘read’ and ‘write’ (need to explain these terms separately because people might not understand what exactly this means) the information from the disk. These two very important tasks are done by the disk head which is at the end of the disk arm. Similar to a race track, there are extremely small tracks on the disk that are divided into chunks called sectors. A small part of the hard disk is used to keep a map or blueprint of which sectors are available to write on and which ones are already written on.</p>

			<p>You might be wondering how the disk head actually reads or writes on the disk: when the hard disk is told by the computer (keeping it simple for now) which sector it wants to read, the disk arm moves so that the disk head is on top of the right track and simply waits for the correct sector to come under the disk head. When the computer tells the hard disk to save something in its memory, the disk arm finds the next available spot (using the map we talked about) and magnetizes a very small spot on the track.</p>
